## No idea? we have some for you…
If you don’t know what to build, we have some ideas for you:

~Create a web service that uses [API](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/P5Ri2TnqqPOzWdRZEE1mEQ) (like a GitHub stats of an account, etc.)

~Import a rich data set, sanitize it, and create a website to visualize the data with interactive zoom and sliders
~Create a music recommender based on a set of ‘liked’ songs
~Write a game that can be played against another person or an AI
~Ship an Android app
~Create an IoT system
~Write an image compression algorithm
~Write a compiler
~Write your own Docker-like container service
~Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of blockchain mining workers with a web page to report on its statistics
~Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of servers hosting docker, with a web page where you can start containers on-demand.
